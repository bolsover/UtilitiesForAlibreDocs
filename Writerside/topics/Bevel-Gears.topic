    <p>This tool can be used to develop models of straight tooth Standard and Gleason bevel gears.</p>
    <img src="BevelGearTool.png" alt="Bevel Gear Tool" width="300" thumbnail="true"/>
    <p>Usage of the tool requires just n parameters be entered by the user:</p>
    <list type="decimal">
        <li><p>Gear Type: Standard or Gleason. The essential difference between these two types is in the dimensions of
            the tooth Addendum (that part of the tooth above the pitch circle diameter) and the Dedendum (that part of
            the tooth below the pitch circle diameter).</p>
            <p>Details of the calculations used by the tool are provided:</p>
            <p><a href="Standard-System-Straight-Bevel-Gears.topic"> Standard bevel gears</a></p>
            <p><a href="Gleason-System-Straight-Bevel-Gears.topic">Gleason bevel gears</a></p>
        </li>
        <li>Shaft Angle: This is the included angle of shafts mounting the Pinion and Gear wheel. Whilst this control is
            limited to 180°, there are other practical limits to what is acceptable here; in general terms, angles
            between 60° and 120° should produce acceptable gears but also depending on the relative number of teeth.
        </li>
        <li>Module: This essentially determines the size of the gear teeth. For convenience, the Imperial equivalent of
            the metric module size is provided in the details table.
        </li>
        <li>Pressure Angle: Commonly used pressure angles are 14.5°, 20° and 25°. Other angles can be defined here if
            required.
        </li>
        <li>Number of Teeth: Set these controls to the desired number of teeth on the Pinion and Gear respectively. Note
            that there is an interdependency between the Pinion and Gear dimensions.
        </li>
        <li>Face width: This sets the width of the generated gear tooth. There are practical limits to the face width.
            It certainly can not exceed the Cone Distance (Re) and is generally limited to Re/3 or 10 times the module
            size.
        </li>
        <li><p>Build Pinion, Build Wheel buttons: These will take the parameters set and pass the details to Alibre.
            The Bevel Gear template file has two sketches:</p>
            <p>Sketch&lt;1&gt; Is used to develop the gear blank profile as a rotation of this sketch.</p>
            <p>Sketch&lt;2&gt; Is used to develop the space between the gear teeth. This sketch is developed on the
                Back Cone Plane used by a Loft Cut feature from the sketch to the Pitch Apex sketch point. The location
                and angle of the Back Cone Plane is calculated by the tool.</p>
            <p>A simple circular feature pattern is used to pattern the loft cut to develop the required number of
                teeth.</p>
            <warning title="Be Patient!">Please note that bevel gears can take some time to generate in Alibre and
                especially when these have large tooth counts!
            </warning>
        </li>
        <li><note>Assembly of Bevel Gears. It is useful to remember that the Pitch Cone Apex of the Pinion and Gear will be
            coincident when the gears are assembled.</note>
