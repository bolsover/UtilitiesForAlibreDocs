    <p>This tool generates spur and helical involute gears in both External and Internal Forms.

    <p>Error checking - a 'reasonable' amount of error checking has been incorporated into the app - it is certainly
        possible for the user to make invalid selections that will not be detected before attempting to build a gear.

    <p>Backlash, Profile and Centre Distance adjustments.</p>
    <p>By default, these adjustments are set to 'Automatic' All the user needs to do is select valid module, pressure angle, helix angle and tooth counts.
    If however more control is needed these adjustments can be set to manual and it is up to the user to enter valid values. </p>
    <p>Typically, gear designers will want to specify the centre distance between a gear pair and it is quite acceptable for this to deviate somewhat from the 'standard'.
    Having adjusted the centre distance, the gear profiles are then sifted to achieve proper meshing of the gears. It is something of a black art!</p>
